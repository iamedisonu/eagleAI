# Job Scraping Integration for EagleAI

## Overview

This document explains how the job scraping functionality has been integrated into your EagleAI project to automatically scrape job openings from intern-list.com and other job boards, then match them to student profiles.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Mock Job Data Service** (`src/services/mockJobData.js`)
- **Purpose**: Simulates job scraping from intern-list.com and other sources
- **Features**:
  - 8 realistic job postings from major companies (Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc.)
  - Match scoring based on skills and experience
  - Different job categories (Software Engineering, Data Science, Product Management, etc.)
  - Mock API functions for testing

### 2. **Job Matches Component** (`src/components/jobs/JobMatches.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Displays matched jobs with filtering and search capabilities
- **Features**:
  - Real-time job matching with scores
  - Advanced filtering by category, job type, location, match score
  - Search functionality
  - Apply and save job actions
  - Pagination support

### 3. **Job Scraping Simulator** (`src/components/jobs/JobScrapingSimulator.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates how the automated scraping process works
- **Features**:
  - Real-time scraping progress simulation
  - Shows scraping from intern-list.com categories
  - Displays statistics and technical implementation details
  - Visual progress indicators

### 4. **Enhanced Career Component** (`src/components/career/Career.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Main container with tabbed interface
- **Features**:
  - Three tabs: Career Paths, Job Matches, Job Scraping
  - Seamless integration of all job-related functionality
  - Responsive design with OC branding

## How to Access the Job Scraping Features

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to Career section**:
   - Click on "Career" in the main navigation
   - You'll see three tabs: "Career Paths", "Job Matches", and "Job Scraping"

3. **Explore the features**:
   - **Job Matches Tab**: View matched jobs with filtering and search
   - **Job Scraping Tab**: See the scraping simulation in action

## Technical Implementation Details

### Real-World Scraping Implementation

To implement actual job scraping from intern-list.com, you would need:

#### 1. **Backend Scraping Service** (Python)
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import schedule
import time

def scrape_intern_list():
    categories = [
        'swe-intern-list',      # Software Engineering
        'da-intern-list',       # Data Analysis
        'pm-intern-list',       # Product Management
        'marketing-intern-list', # Marketing
        'design-intern-list'    # Design
    ]
    
    jobs = []
    for category in categories:
        url = f"https://www.intern-list.com/{category}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
        
        # Extract job listings
        job_elements = soup.find_all(class_="job-listing")
        for job_elem in job_elements:
            job = {
                'title': job_elem.find("h2").text,
                'company': job_elem.find(class_="company").text,
                'location': job_elem.find(class_="location").text,
                'description': job_elem.find(class_="description").text,
                'application_url': job_elem.find("a")["href"],
                'posted_date': job_elem.find(class_="date").text,
                'category': category.replace('-intern-list', '')
            }
            jobs.append(job)
    
    return jobs

# Schedule scraping every 6 hours
schedule.every(6).hours.do(scrape_intern_list)
```

#### 2. **Database Schema** (MongoDB)
```javascript
// Job Collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  company: String,
  location: String,
  description: String,
  applicationUrl: String,
  postedDate: Date,
  category: String,
  skills: [String],
  requirements: [String],
  jobType: String, // internship, full-time, part-time
  isRemote: Boolean,
  salaryRange: {
    min: Number,
    max: Number
  }
}

// Student Match Collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  studentId: String,
  jobId: ObjectId,
  matchScore: Number,
  matchedSkills: [String],
  missingSkills: [String],
  status: String, // interested, applied, saved
  applicationStatus: String // not-applied, applied, rejected
}
```

#### 3. **Matching Algorithm** (Node.js)
```javascript
function calculateMatchScore(studentProfile, job) {
  let score = 0;
  const studentSkills = studentProfile.skills || [];
  const jobSkills = job.skills || [];
  
  // Skill matching (70% of score)
  const matchedSkills = studentSkills.filter(skill => 
    jobSkills.some(jobSkill => 
      jobSkill.toLowerCase().includes(skill.toLowerCase())
    )
  );
  score += (matchedSkills.length / jobSkills.length) * 70;
  
  // Experience level matching (20% of score)
  if (studentProfile.experienceLevel === job.experienceLevel) {
    score += 20;
  }
  
  // Location preference (10% of score)
  if (job.isRemote || studentProfile.preferredLocations.includes(job.location)) {
    score += 10;
  }
  
  return Math.round(score);
}
```

#### 4. **Real-time Notifications** (WebSocket)
```javascript
// Notify students of new job matches
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.on('join-student-room', (studentId) => {
    socket.join(`student-${studentId}`);
  });
});

// When new jobs are scraped and matched
function notifyStudentOfNewJobs(studentId, newJobs) {
  io.to(`student-${studentId}`).emit('new-job-matches', {
    jobs: newJobs,
    timestamp: new Date()
  });
}
```

## Current Features Working

✅ **Job Matches Display**: Shows 8 mock jobs with match scores  
✅ **Filtering & Search**: Filter by category, job type, location, match score  
✅ **Apply & Save Actions**: Mock functionality for job applications  
✅ **Scraping Simulation**: Visual demonstration of the scraping process  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices  
✅ **OC Branding**: Consistent with your brand colors and styling  

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Set up backend server** with Node.js/Express or Python/Flask
2. **Implement actual scraping** using the Python code above
3. **Set up MongoDB** for job and student data storage
4. **Add WebSocket support** for real-time notifications
5. **Implement user authentication** for student profiles
6. **Add email notifications** for new job matches
7. **Deploy scraping service** on a cloud platform (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.)

## Legal Considerations

- **Check robots.txt**: Ensure scraping complies with intern-list.com's terms
- **Rate limiting**: Don't overwhelm their servers with requests
- **Terms of service**: Review their terms before implementing
- **Data usage**: Only use scraped data for legitimate educational purposes

## Testing the Current Implementation

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Navigate to the "Career" section
3. Click on "Job Matches" tab to see the job listings
4. Click on "Job Scraping" tab to see the scraping simulation
5. Try the filtering and search features
6. Test the apply and save buttons

The job scraping functionality is now fully integrated and ready for demonstration!
